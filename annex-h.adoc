*Formerly Appendix A.17 in Volume 2 of the OGC CDB Best Practice*

The CDB standard supports JPEG2000 for both VSTI and VSTLM component
data.

As a result of the high rates of compression there are no real
advantages to be gained in supporting a broad range of alternate color
representations (such as single channel representations, indexed color
representations, RGB-triplet color encoding such as 5-6-5, etc.). The
underlying motivation behind all such schemes is driven by a desire to
reduce storage and transmission bandwidths. JPEG-2000 achieves these
goals and many others, refer to Table A-8 JPEG 2000 Features.

|=======================================================================
a|
High compression efficiency:

Compression better than 0.25 bits per pixels, 20% compression efficiency
improvement over JPEG.

 a|
High dynamic range:

Compress images with various dynamic ranges (e.g. 1-16 bit) for each
color component.

a|
*Lossless and lossy compression:*

Lossless compression ratios approx. 1.7:1.

 a|
*Seamless quality / resolution scalability:*

Without having to download the entire file.

a|
*Progressive image reconstruction:*

Allows images to be reconstructed with increasing pixel accuracy and
resolution.

 |*Large images sizes - up to (2^32^ - 1).*

|*Perceptual color space internal coding.* |*Single decompression
architecture.*

a|
*Region of interest coding:*

Permits certain ROIâ€™s in the image to be coded and transmitted with
better quality and less distortion than the rest of the image.

 |*Error resilience during transfers.*
