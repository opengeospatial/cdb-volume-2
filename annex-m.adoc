[Appendix]
=  Annex M: CDB Directory Naming and Structure

*Formerly Appendix M, Volume 2 of the OGC CDB Best Practice*

With CDB version 3.2 (prior to the submission into the OGC), Appendix M
was used to present the complete list of names allowed to construct the
directories of the CDB. As of version 3.2 (as submitted into the OGC
standards process), the appendix has been replaced by a combination of
folder hierarchy and metadata files and controlled vocabularies
delivered with the CDB Distribution Package.

The /CDB folder hierarchy provides a complete list of directory and file
name patterns of the CDB; it summarizes the structure of the CDB
presented in chapter 3, Volume 1: Core. The following files are
necessary to expand the patterns:

* /CDB/Metadata/Feature_Data_Dictionary.xml provides the list of
directory names associated with feature codes;
* /CDB/Metadata/Moving_Model_Codes.xml provides the list of names for
DIS Entity Kinds, Domains, and Categories; and
* /CDB/Metadata/DIS_Country_Codes.xml contains the list of DIS Country
Names.

Together, these files provide all the information required to build the
names of all directories permitted by the CDB standard.
